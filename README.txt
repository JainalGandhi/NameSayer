===== Installation =====
Place the provided names database, the names folder, in the same directory as the 
provided jar file, namesayer.jar. To run, either double click namesayer.jar or
 in the terminal run the command java -jar namesayer.jar

===== Brief User Manual =====
Starting:
On startup additional wav files may be added to the database, so long as they follow
the naming convention. Otherwise you can begin.

Main Screen:
To add names to the playlist, you may either import text documents following the format
where each new line is a full name, or enter the search bar to find names in the
database and then proceed to add them to the playlist.

You can shuffle the playlist, move forwards and backwards through it, and add names or
clear it at any time.

By badly rating a name, you can select which name, if the name has more than one part, 
to badly rate. Doing so will cause that version of the name not to be selected in
future playlists, if other variations are available.

Selecting past recording will play the most recent user attempt at the selected name, 
if such a recording exists.

Practicing:
By selecting practice on the main screen, you can practice the name currently selected
in the playlist. You have the options to play the name again and record your own attempt.
If a recording has been made, it can be played back, or compared to the original a number
of times. It can also be saved, allowing for it to be played at a later time from the
main screen under past recording.

Scoring:
To increase your score, you have to open the practice module and record yourself practicing
each name. If the record button is not pressed, and you change to a different name, then
your score/streak goes back to 0. As your score increases, you may receive new skins, which
act as rewards.

===== Target Audience =====
The target audience for this application is a universtiy lecturer. To satisfy this, we
went for a minimal theme. A lecturer does not want anything too animated or fancy.
We also had a bonus feature of allowing the user to import multiple text files (perhaps
one per course he teaches) so he can learn all student names from all courses at once.
